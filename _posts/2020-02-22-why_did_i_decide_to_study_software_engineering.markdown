Myspace was what initially sparked my interest in tech in 2005-2008. My sister showed me how to customize my default background and embed an MP3 player of my favorite songs. We didn’t know it back then, but we were coding! Although I was an A student, I never even considered it as a potential career path because I thought software engineering and all of that “advanced computer stuff” was for the really smart people.
 
After high school I played basketball in college and got my degree in finance. I landed a job in my field and worked in the investment industry for six years, which was long enough to find out that it wasn’t what I wanted to do. I was searching for something that I was good at and also passionate about. I took a sales job selling advertising to lawyers, which was a drain and was definitely not it. Then I moved to Los Angeles to pursue music full time as a  producer/musician/songwriter. Music is something I enjoy but it wasn’t paying the bills. So, after a stressful two years of living in LA I decided to move back to Seattle. It turned out to be a great decision because two weeks later I tore my achilles playing basketball and needed the support and care of my family. While I was laid up for a few weeks and unemployed for several months, I was able to reflect on the things I’ve done. I received encouragement from friends who are in tech – at Facebook and Disney – and then I found Career Karma, which all worked together to  shape a long distant interest into a real desire to explore it. Now 13 years later, I am a student in Flatiron’s coding bootcamp, and very excited to finally tackle this thing. 
 
Dissatisfaction was my biggest motivator for change. I am not afraid of making moves and taking risks because failures teach valuable lessons for future successes, but I want to make smarter moves and coding is it. Tech is now and the future, so the opportunities are plenty, and the industry needs more people of color. It’s time for me to take full advantage of my skills and interests, and to finally thrive in a rewarding career, with the hope of one day giving back and inspiring others to do the same. This journey will be challenging, my resolve will be tested, but the reward will be so great. Like we say on the court, “let’s get it, let’s go!”
